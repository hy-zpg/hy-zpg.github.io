Furthermore, discrete representations are a natural fit for complex reasoning, planning and predictive learning. ** learning discrete representation: vector quantization. ** methods: testing by removing encoder and using autogressive model pixelCNN to build relation aming the dimension of sampling Z.

    <content type="text"><![CDATA[Few-shot Image GenerationFew-shot Image Generation with Elastic Weight Consolidation NIPS 2020 paper core idea: preserving the diversity of source domain, adapting the information of source domain to the target domain with a few sampels from target domain with adapting the pretrained model’s weights. storyline: ** 70,000 images for just a specific domain (aligned faces) or 1.3M images across different classes -&gt; in the artistic domain, it is at best cumbersome, and at times prohibitive, to hire artists to make thousands of creations -&gt; our goal is to generalize from a few, new examples. our setting need much data belonging to same domain such as flowers, animal faces, then using a few samples from different category like funit regarding category as domain. ** training an algorithm to generate more data of a target domain, given only a few examples. An underlying assumption with this setup is that the source and target domains share some latent factors, with some differences related to their distinct difference in appearance. finding shared some latent code, how near or how far. ** propose a straightforward and effective adaptation technique, adapting the pretrained model’s weights, without introducing additional parameters. Fixing the architecture implies that tedious manual designs on new parameters are not necessary. ** A key property to note is that weights have different levels of importance; thus, each parameter should not be treated equally in the adaptation, or tuning process. we consider there will always be an inherent trade-off between preserving information from the source and adapting to the target domain. the number of target examples and the dissimilarity between the source and target domain. method: ** we do the adaptation with a few examples, some weights in the last layer are more important and should be better preserved than those in other layers. ** we could directly use Fisher information as an importance measure for weights and add a regularization loss to penalize the weight change. setting: big domain without considering the category of source domain and target domain. real faces vs. emoji faces. experiment: * datasets: real faces (200k) vs. emoji faces (80k), animal faces (10 5000) vs. portrait paintings (16 * 10). landscape photos (5000) vs. pencil landscape drawings(10). data size 10-80k ** evaluation metrics: FID(user study) for more taget images (less target images) and LPIPS. ** visualization. Few-shot Adaptation of Generative Adversarial Networks ICLR 2021 paper core idea: proposesing a simple and effective method, Few-Shot GAN (FSGAN), for adapting GANs in few-shot settings (less than 100 images) by repurposing component analysis techniques and learns to adapt the singular values of the pre-trained weights while freezing the corresponding singular vectors. storyline: ** Training these models, however, typically requires large, diverse datasets in a target visual domain -&gt; low-data regime (e.g., less than 1,000 samples), GANs frequently suffer from memorization or instability, leading to a lack of diversity or poor visual quality -&gt; transfer learning, images generated by GAN-based methods are blurry and lack details, flow-based models require compute- and memory-intensive architectures. ** we restrict the space of trainable parameters to a small number of highly-expressive parameters that modulate orthogonal features of the pre-trained weight space. ** Our method first applies singular value decomposition (SVD) to the network weights of a pretrained GAN (generator + discriminator). We then adapts the singular values using GAN optimization on the target few-shot domain, with fixed left/right singular vectors. We show that varying singular values in the weight space corresponds to semantically meaningful changes of the synthesized image while preserving natural structure. proposed method achieves higher image quality after adaptation. setting: big domain without considering the category of source domain and target domain. real faces vs. emoji faces. experiments: ** datasets: LSUN Churches→ Van Gogh paintings(30), FFHQ→Art portraits(5-100), FFHQ→Anime Rem ID(25). data size 5-100 ** metrics: FID, sharpness, and face quality index (FQI). Augmentation-Interpolative AutoEncoders for Unsupervised Few-Shot Image Generation paper core idea: autoencoders generalize extremely well to new domains, even when trained on highly constrained data. storyline: ** generating high-quality, diverse, high-resolution images requires a large dataset -&gt; need generative models that can train on one set of image classes, and then generalize to a new class using only a small quantity of new images: few-shot image generation. ** previous methods need large labeled datasets of hundreds of classes, substantial computation at test time, highly domain-specific, generalizing only across very similar classes. ** We leverage the finding that although the latent spaces of powerful generative models, such as VAEs and GANs, do not generalize to new classes, the representations learned by autoencoders (AEs) generalize extremely well -&gt; Interpolative AutoEncoders -&gt; Augmentation-Interpolative Autoencoder (AugIntAE) achieves simple, robust, highly general, and completely unsupervised few-shot image generation. setting: given a large, unlabelled collection of images depicting objects from a set of seen classes and a very small set of images - as few as two - belonging to a novel class, Our goal is to train a network on seen classes and generates images clearly belonging to the novel class. interpolating a pair of unseen images to generate new images belonging to the novel class. experiments: ** datasets:MNIST → EMNIST , Omniglot (train → test), CelebA (male → female) , CIFAR-10 → CIFAR-100 ** metrics: FID score and train/test classification error. MineGAN: effective knowledge transfer from GANs to target domains with few images CVPR 2020 paper core idea: using a miner network that identifies which part of the generative distribution of each pretrained GAN outputs samples closest to the target domain. storyline: high-quality pretrained models -&gt; combining high-quality pretrained models with other models and adjust them to a target distribution is a desirable objective -&gt; knowledge transfer for generative models has received significantly less attention, possibly due to its great difficulty, especially when transferring to target domains with few images -&gt; previous works severely limits the flexibility of the knowledge transfer, mode collapse -&gt; a miner network that transforms a multivariate normal distribution into a distribution on the input space of the pretrained GAN in such a way that the generated images resemble those of the target domain. setting: big domain without considering the category of source domain and target domain. human faces vs. children faces. experiment: ** dataset: CelebA→FFHQ children, data size 100-1000 ** evaluation: MV, KMMD, FID CharacterGAN: Few-Shot Keypoint Character Animation and Reposing paper GAN Memory with No Forgetting NIPS 2020 paper On Leveraging Pretrained GANs for Generation with Limited Data ICML 2020 paper Differentiable Augmentation for Data-Efficient GAN Training NIPS 2020 paper method: improving the data efficiency of GANs by imposing various types of differentiable augmentations on both real and fake samples. storyline: ** The performance of generative adversarial networks (GANs) heavily deteriorates given a limited amount of training data. This is mainly because the discriminator is memorizing the exact training set. ** it is of critical importance to eliminate the need of immense datasets for GAN training. ** suggesting that the discriminator is simply memorizing the entire training set. This severe over-fitting problem disrupts the training dynamics and leads to degraded image quality. ** augmentations (cropping, flipping, scaling, color jittering, and region masking) in real images, the generator would be encouraged to match the distribution of the augmented images. ** augmentation need to be done in real images and generate images, which breaks the subtle balance between the generator and discriminator, leading to poor convergence as they are optimizing completely different objectives. ** DiffAugment, which applies the same differentiable augmentation to both real and fake images for both generator and discriminator training. It enables the gradients to be propagated through the augmentation back to the generator, regularizes the discriminator without manipulating the target distribution, and maintains the balance of training dynamics. setting: training set data size 25% ~ 100% Training Generative Adversarial Networks with Limited Data NIPS 2020 paper methods: augmentation strtegies in discriminator. setting: training set data size 1k ~ 200k Image Generation From Small Datasets via Batch Statistics Adaptation 2019 ICCV paper core idea: Using such prior knowledge, the model can generate images leveraging some common sense that cannot be acquired from a small datase. method: we propose a novel method focusing on the pa- rameters for batch statistics, scale and shift, of the hidden layers in the generator. By training only these parameters in a supervised manner, we achieved stable training of the generator, and our method can generate higher quality images compared to previous methods without collapsing, even when the dataset is small (data size 25 ~ 500 ). setting: selecting pretrained model SNGAN and BigGAN. All experiments in this paper are not class conditional, but our method can be easily extended to be class-conditional by learning BatchNorm statistics for each class independently. experiment: ** dataset: FFHQ dataset -&gt; anime face datase, imagenet -&gt; oxford flowers. ** metrics: FID, KMMD Inspiration few-shot image generation - source domain: category information, conditional GAN -> targte domain: category information, presevring diversity information and distinctive feature among different categories.

    <content type="text"><![CDATA[Video-to-videoCo-segmentation Inspired Attention Networks for Video-based Person Re-identification setting: v-t-v issue: severe occlusions, background clutter, viewpoint change, etc. noisy background features from irrelevant non-salient regions may get misinterpreted as the person’s features and get aggregated in the video descriptor. the subject alignment and scene variation aggravate the prolem and result in a drastic drop in Re-ID accuracy. misses out the salient accessories associated with the subject (e.g., backpack, bag, hat and coat) that are also important cues for Re-ID. problem: background nosiy need to be ignored, associated with the subject (e.g., backpack, bag, hat and coat) need to be paid attention. previous method: Co-attention by leveraging inter-video (probe vs. gallery video snippets) co-attention(computationally expensive). method:discovered a set of distinctive body parts using diverse spatial attentions and discriminative frames by a temporal attention model. effectively captures the attention between frames of a video. effects: interpretable. Global-Local Temporal Representations For Video Person Re-Identification setting: v-t-v issue: however they still show certain limitations in the aspects of either efficiency or the capability of temporal cues modeling. motivation: the short-term temporal cue among adjacent frames helps to distinguish visually similar pedestrians. The long-term temporal cue helps to alleviate the occlusions and noises in video sequences. method: exploit the multi-scale temporal cues in video sequences. short-term temporal cues among adjacent frames, then capturing the long-term relations among inconsecutive frames. the short-term temporal cues are modeled by parallel dilated convolutions with different temporal dilation rates to represent the motion and appearance of pedestriain. The long-term relations are captured by a temporal self-attention model to alleviate the occlusions and noises in video sequences. Spatial-Temporal Graph Convolutional Network for Video-based Person Re-identification setting: v-t-v issue: the occlusion problem and the visual ambiguity problem for visually similar negative samples. motivation: modeling the temporal relations of different frames and the spatial relations within a frame has the potential for solving the above problems. method: two GCN branches, a spatial one and a temporal one. The spatial branch extracts structural information of a human body. The temporal branch mines discriminative cues from adjacent frames. Learning Multi-Granular Hypergraphs for Video-Based Person Re-Identification setting: v-t-v issue: misalignment and occlusion Appearance-Preserving 3D Convolution for Video-based Person Re-identification setting: v-to-v issue: temporal coherence method: we disentangle the video representation into the temporal coherence and motion parts and randomly change the scale of the temporal motion features as the adversarial noise. Temporal Complementary Learning for Video Person Re-Identification setting: v-to-v issue: do not take full advantage of the rich spatial-temporal clues in the video. The redundant features typically attend to the same local salient parts, which are difficult to distinguish the persons with similar appearance. method: discover diverse visual cues for different frames of a video to form a full characteristic of each identify. erases the most salient part of the second and subsequent frames of the input video sequence.

Paper2 paper links: Low-shot Learning via Covariance-Preserving Adversarial Augmentation Networks feature augmentation. addressing the problem of Low-shot Visual Recognition by Shrinking and Hallucinating Features: learn a finite set of transformation mappings between examples in each base category and directly apply them to seed novel points for extra data. However, since mappings areenumerable (even in large amount), this model suffers from poor generalization. intra-class variances of base classes are shareable with any novel classes. building upon the assumption that related classes should have similar intra-class variance, we introduce a new loss term for preserving covariance during the translation process. incorporating extra noise from a mixture of Gaussian distributions could result in morediverse results. preserving covariance information from relevant base classes to a novel class can improve low-shot generation quality. weighted loss: similarity, weights assigned to each training samples (the distance between noval class and base class).

CVAE-GAN: the encoder network E(x-&gt;z), the generative network G(z-&gt;\tilt{x}), the discriminatove network D(distinguish x from \tilt{x}), the classifier network C(measure the class probability of the data), cascaded together and trained end-to-end. application: generation, inpainting, attribute morphing. l2 loss and pari-wise feature matching enable the G to generate structure-preserving samples. formulation mean feature matching in basic GAN (G+D): extracting feature from the discriminator to form mean feature matching to optimize the generator loss(L_GD). also can combining the feature form multi-layer.(can be applied in our dagan) mean feature mathcing in classifier(G+C): in the classifier, extracting feature from the classifier to form mean feature matching to optimize the generator loss(L_GC),also can combining the feature form multi-layer.(can be applied in our dagan) pair-wise feature matching: combining l2 loss and pair-wise feature matching loss the detail of Joint Discriminative and Generative Learning for Person Re-identification solved problem: intra-class variations across different cameras. method: improve learned reid embedding by better using agmented images with a joint framwork that couple the data generation and reid learning end-to-end. the generative module (appearance code and structure code) and the discrinative (sharing appearance code with the generative module). so appearance code plays a role of category-related embedding. coupling the generative module for image generation and the discriminative module for reid learning. reason: let the classification module can ‘see’ these variations (intr-class variations and inter-class variations) during training process. generate images by swith the appearance code and structure code given the same identities or the different identities. formulation generative module: self-identity generation, cross-identity generation. discriminative module: primary feature learning, fine-grained feature mining, which is codesigned with the generative module. my thinking the generative module is resposible to generate images that contain significant intra-class variations (imagenet dataset including different background, FIGR-8 dataset including different style, omniglot dataset including different style, vggFace including different ages, skin colors). the generative module can be designed as two part including category-related code and category-unrelated code. the generative module is responsible to generate high-quality cross-category images. the category-related module can encode category related semantics, while the category-unrelated module can enclose geometry and posion related structure information the discriminative module accept the cross-category images generated by the generative module to improve the discriminative module. additionaly, the classification module can be combined with the discriminative module, so the whole process can make contributions to the classification. ‘realism’: generated images should close domain gap between the genrated images ans the real ones. ‘diversity’: generated images should contain sufficient diversity cover ‘unseen’ intra-class variations. the generative process should align with the classification task to enlarge the gain from the generated images.]]></content>

    <content type="text"><![CDATA[Similarity Both aim at constructing a model that can map latent variabels $z$ to object data $p_{data}$. specifically, the trained model $\mathbf{X} = g(\mathbf{Z})$ where $Z$ is general distribution such as normal distribution and gaussian distribution, $\mathbf{X}$ represents the probability distribution of training data. So they both aim at distribution transformation. Both have generative problem that it’s difficult to obtain distribution expression of generated distribution and true distribution, only samples from two distribution are available. $KL$ divergence only be applied to calculte distribution differene on the condition that complete distribution expressions are provided, so it is unapplicable in this scenario. Difference Measurement method: manmade measurement rule for VAE while this measurement rule of GAN is trained by neural network. GAN: proposed to leverage deep neural networks to measure distribution difference because there isn’t suitable measurement method. VAE: adopt a roundabout skill to leverage $KL$ divergence. VAEImportant points The detail is here VAE’s blog Notes: each sample has a gaussian distribution constructed by multivariate Gaussion and then obtain $z$ by sampling it from this distribution:\begin{equation}\log q_{\phi}\left(\mathbf{z} | \mathbf{x}^{(i)}\right)=\log \mathcal{N}\left(\mathbf{z} ; \boldsymbol{\mu}^{(i)}, \boldsymbol{\sigma}^{2(i)} \mathbf{I}\right)\end{equation} Notes: $log \boldsymbol{\mu_k} = f_1(x_k), \boldsymbol{\sigma}^{2(k)} = f_2(x_k)$ which are both fitted by neural network. Noise from constructed $z$ can be calculated from $\sigma$ which can be controlled to zero, so noise takes no effect. Generative ability is based on the condition that all $p(Z\X)$ close to gaussion distribution. \begin{equation}p(Z)=\sum_{X} p(Z | X) p(X)=\sum_{X} \mathcal{N}(0, I) p(X)=\mathcal{N}(0, I) \sum_{X} p(X)=\mathcal{N}(0, I)\end{equation} so $p(Z)$ subjects to normal distribution, which satisfy the prior. how: intruducing reconstruction loss:direct method:\begin{equation}\mathcal{L}_{\mu}=\left|f_{1}\left(X_{k}\right)\right|^{2}\end{equation} \begin{equation}\mathcal{L}_{\sigma^{2}}=\left|f_{2}\left(X_{k}\right)\right|^{2}\end{equation} it’s difficult to measure those loss, so it’s reasonable to introduce $KL$ divegence between standard gaussion distribution and independent gaussion distribution $K L\left(N\left(\mu, \sigma^{\wedge}\right) | N(0, l)\right)$:\begin{equation}\mathcal{L}_{\mu, \sigma^{2}}=\frac{1}{2} \sum_{i=1}^{d}\left(\mu_{(i)}^{2}+\sigma_{(i)}^{2}-\log \sigma_{(i)}^{2}-1\right)\end{equation}where $d$ is the dimension of $z$ Essence of VAE Two encoder: $f_1$ for $\mu$ while $f_2$ for $\sigma$ Reconstruction process: the loss of decoder assume that there is no noise; Sample $z$ process: the loss of encoder assume that there is gaussion noise. GANImportant points GAN is used to map normal distribution $p(z)$ into specfic distribution $p(x)$.]]></content>

Both of them inspired from Matching networks for one shot learning Remaining bottlenecks in deep generative models extensive training leading to slow training (currently experience in DCGAN, FIGR). difficulities with generalization from small number of training examples. Solution to those bottlenecks conditional generative models: adapting generative distribution to additional inputs. the restriction of previous research: the input data to be a single object or multiple objects represents the same concepts. Novelty of generative matching networks VAE + matching network without explicit limitations on the numbles of additional inputs objects or the number of concepts.(experiment not demonstrate this, conditional GAN may achieve it.) learn new concepts. ImplementingSpecific problem VAE has been transfered intractable optimization into tractable optmization problem, refer to Overview of Generative Models. However, update of parameters computed from a small portion of training data have a immediate effect for the whole dataset. cann’t quickly adaption because of not incremental learning. original optimization objective\begin{aligned}\log p(\mathbf{x} | \boldsymbol{\theta}) \geq \mathcal{L}(\boldsymbol{\theta}, \boldsymbol{\phi})=\mathbb{E}_{q}[\log p(\mathbf{x}, \mathbf{z} | \boldsymbol{\theta})-\log q(\mathbf{z} | \mathbf{x}, \boldsymbol{\phi})]=\log p(\mathbf{x} | \boldsymbol{\theta})-\operatorname{KL}(q | p(\cdot | \mathbf{x}, \boldsymbol{\theta}))\end{aligned} Generative matching networks different VAE which is x -&gt; z -&gt; x, the framework of this model is from z -&gt;x -&gt; z. incorporating knowledge from newly available data is conditioning, so design model as $p(\mathbf{x} | \mathbf{X}, \boldsymbol{\theta})$ conditioning on additional input data $\mathbf{X}$.\begin{aligned}p(\mathbf{x}, \mathbf{z} | \mathbf{X}, \boldsymbol{\theta})=p(\mathbf{z} | \mathbf{X}, \boldsymbol{\theta}) p(\mathbf{x} | \mathbf{z}, \mathbf{X}, \boldsymbol{\theta})\end{aligned} followed VAE, maintaining a recognition model approximating the posterior over latent variable $z$ to achieve lower bound optimization objective, so,\begin{equation}q(\mathbf{z} | \mathbf{x}, \mathbf{X}, \boldsymbol{\phi}) \approx p(\mathbf{z} | \mathbf{x}, \mathbf{X}, \boldsymbol{\theta})\end{equation} Basic modelFlow chat of generative matching networks the objective is:\begin{equation}p(\mathbf{x}, \mathbf{z} | \mathbf{X}, \boldsymbol{\theta})=p(\mathbf{z} | \mathbf{X}, \boldsymbol{\theta}) p(\mathbf{x} | \mathbf{z}, \mathbf{X}, \boldsymbol{\theta})\end{equation} In conditional likelihood (decoder) $p(\mathbf{x} | \mathbf{z}, \mathbf{X}, \boldsymbol{\theta})$: $\mathbf{x}$ is additional input data which is conditional objects. $\mathbf{z}$ is the prior. $f_L$ and $g_L$ are used to map latent variabels and conditioning objects into feature space $\phi$. $f_L$ is simple affine transformation while $g_L$ is a convolutional network. $\phi_L$ is feature extractor different from $g_L$ but sharing some parameters between them. mapping $r_L$ to $x$ by a deconvulutional network. In recognition model (encoder) $q(\mathbf{z} | \mathbf{X}, \mathbf{x})$: $g_R = f_R = g_L$ $\phi_L$ = $\phi_R$ $r_R$ is used to compute parameters of approximate posterior which is a normal distribution.

    <content type="text"><![CDATA[The detail of generative model can refer to generative modelsDefinition of generative modelsgiven training data, generate new samples from same distribution\begin{aligned}\mathrm{p}_{model}(\mathrm{x}) { similar to } \mathrm{p}_(\mathrm{x})\end{aligned} Taxonomy of Generative models PixelsRNN and PixelsCNN this method belongs to explicit density model. Using chain rule to decompose likelihood of an image x into product of 1-d distributions: \begin{aligned} p_{\theta}(x)=\prod_{i=1}^{n} p_{\theta}\left(x_{i} | x_{1}, \ldots, x_{i-1}\right)\end{aligned} where $x_i$ represents pixel, $p(x)$ denoets the likelihood of image $x$ it’s important to define ordering of those pixels complex distribution over pixels can be sloved by neural networks pros: explicitly compute likelihood $p(x)$. cons: sequential generation is slow. PixelsRNN generating image pixels from corner, and then using RNN(LSTM) to model dependency on previous pixels. drawback is that the process of sequential generation if slow. PixelsCNN generating image pixels from corner, and then using CNN to cover context region. generation proceed sequentially is still slow. Variational Autoenconders general explanation is here VAE this method defines intractable density function with latent $z$: \begin{aligned}p_{\theta}(x)=\int p_{\theta}(z) p_{\theta}(x | z) d z\end{aligned} Autoencoders mapping image $x$ to features $z$ with deep neural networks, $z$ is regarded to capture meaningful factors of variation in data. to learn feature $z$ by reconstruction error: $x$ -&gt; $z$ -&gt; $\hat_{x}$ with encoder and decoder. Variational Autoenconders for generation problem Assuming training data $x(i)$ representation $z$ is generated from latent representation $z$. Specifically, first sampling $z$ from true prior $p_{\theta}(z)$, then sampling $x$ from true conditional $p_{\theta}(x|z^(i))$ the aim is to estimate the true parameter $\theta$ by maximuming likelihood of training data : \begin{equation}p_{\theta}(x)=\int p_{\theta}(z) p_{\theta}(x | z) d z\end{equation} where $p_{\theta}(z)$ is gaussion prior, and $p_{\theta}(x | z) $ is decoder. intractable optimization problem, because it’s impossible to compute $p(x | z)$ for every $z$ which means the integral operation is fail in this condition. posterior density $p_{\theta}(z | x)=p_{\theta}(x | z) p_{\theta}(z) / p_{\theta}(x)$ is also intractable, since $p_{\theta}(x)$ is intractable data likelihood. lower bound of VAE why: intractable, transfer optimization how: In addition to decoder network modeling $p_\theta(x|z)$, define additional encoder network $q_{\phi}(z|x)$ that approximates $p_\theta(z|x)$ final optimization objective:\begin{aligned}\log p_{\theta}\left(x^{(i)}\right)\\&amp;=\mathbf{E}_{z \sim q_{\phi}\left(z | x^{(i)}\right)}\left[\log p_{\theta}\left(x^{(i)}\right)\right]\\&amp;=\mathbf{E}_{z}\left[\log \frac{p_{\theta}\left(x^{(i)} | z\right) p_{\theta}(z)}{p_{\theta}\left(z | x^{(i)}\right)}\right]\\&amp;=\mathbf{E}_{z}\left[\log \frac{p_{\theta}\left(x^{(i)} | z\right) p_{\theta}(z)}{p_{\theta}\left(z | x^{(i)}\right)} \frac{q_{\phi}\left(z | x^{(i)}\right)}{q_{\phi}\left(z | x^{(i)}\right)}\right]\\&amp;=\mathbf{E}_{z}\left[\log p_{\theta}\left(x^{(i)} | z\right)\right]-\mathbf{E}_{z}\left[\log \frac{q_{\phi}\left(z | x^{(i)}\right)}{p_{\theta}(z)}\right]+\mathbf{E}_{z}\left[\log \frac{q_{\phi}\left(z | x^{(i)}\right)}{p_{\theta}\left(z | x^{(i)}\right)}\right]\\&amp;=\mathbf{E}_{z}\left[\log p_{\theta}\left(x^{(i)} | z\right)\right]-D_{K L}\left(q_{\phi}\left(z | x^{(i)}\right) | p_{\theta}(z)\right)+D_{K L}\left(q_{\phi}\left(z | x^{(i)}\right) | p_{\theta}\left(z | x^{(i)}\right)\right)\end{aligned}where $\mathbf{E}_{z}\left[\log p_{\theta}\left(x^{(i)} | z\right)\right]$ is used to reconstruct the input data, $q_{\phi}\left(z | x^{(i)}\right) | p_{\theta}(z)$ is used to make approximate posterior distribution close to prior. lower bound: transfering intractable problem into tractale problem with lower bounds, introducing encoder $_{\phi}$ to transfer two KL divergence, in which one is tractable while another one is untractabel. Thus, lower bound aims at optimizing the tractable KL divergence. the detail of optimization procedure as follows: GAN\begin{equation}{\min {G} \max {D} V(D, G)=}{\mathbb{E}{\boldsymbol{x} \sim p{\text {data}}(\boldsymbol{x})}[\log D(\boldsymbol{x})]+\mathbb{E}{\boldsymbol{z} \sim p{\boldsymbol{z}}(\boldsymbol{z})}[\log (1-D(G(\boldsymbol{z}))]}\end{equation} where $D(x)$ represents the probability of $x$ sourced from real data.]]></content>

The novalty may be regarded as a baseline (waiting to understand the detail). data imbalance in joint training strategy, such as 20k~ pose dataset AFLW and 90k~ emotion dataset ExpW. Pseudo data selectionBecause much noisy data can effect the model performance and even disturb the model training process, leading to poor model performance, pseudo data selection can control the ratio of pseudo data in the whole datasets. Density reason: because clusters are easily detected by the local density of data points, in the pseudo data belong to same categoty have similar feature. Appling a density based clustering algorithm that measures the complexity of psuedo data using data distribution density in. each category. implementation detail: measuring the purity of data with pseudo label based on its distribution density in a feature space, and rank the purity to generate pseudo weights, pseudo data with higher density is assigned larger weights, while smaller weights are assigned to low-density pseudo data. Distribution distance reason: ‘transfer learning is one important method in machine learning, it can relax the condition of the independent identical distribution in train dataset and test dataset, so that knowledge can be transfered from source domain to target domain’,’its main application includes domain adaptation and multi-domain tranferation’. instance-based domain adaption: calculating the distance between source domain data and target domain data, then adjusting the weights of target domain instance so that the target data can be matched with source domain data. In detail, the smaller distance, the higher similarity. implementation detail: GMM reason: implementation: generating Gaussian Mixture models (GMM) based on A1 (data with pseuodo label) and B (data with ground truth) in each categoty. Assuming GMM has K Gaussian models, we obtain G(A1_1), …, G(A1_K), G(B1_1), …, G(B1_K); EMD reason: &gt;reference Large Scale Fine-Grained Categorization and Domain-Specific Transfer Learning, which takes domain scale into account by adding a scale factor. In this paper, transfer learning can be viewed as moving a set of images from the source domain S to the target domain T. The work needed to be done by moving an image to another can be defined as their feature Euaullean distance, so the distance between two domains can be defined as the least amount of total work needed. This definition of domain similarity can be calculated by the Earth Mover’s Distance (EMD). original EMD equation \begin{aligned}\sum_{i=1}^{m}\sum_{j=1}^{n}f_{i,j}=\min {\sum_{i=1}^{m}w_{pi},\quad \sum_{j=1}^{n}w_{qj}}\end{aligned} \begin{aligned}EMD(P,Q)={\frac {\sum_{i=1}^{m}\sum_{j=1}^{n}f_{i,j}d_{i,j}}{\sum_{i=1}^{m}\sum_{j=1}^{n}f_{i,j}}}\end{aligned} \begin{aligned}P={(p_{1},w_{p1}),(p_{2},w_{p2}),…,(p_{m},w_{pm})}\end{aligned} \begin{aligned}Q={(q_{1},w_{q1}),(q_{2},w_{q2}),…,(q_{n},w_{qn})}\end{aligned} reference paper EMD applicationg(s{i}) from the mean value of image features in category i from source domaing(t{i}) from the mean value of image features in category i from target domain\begin{aligned}\sum_{i=1}^{m}\sum_{j=1}^{n}f_{i,j}=\min {\sum_{i=1}^{m}w_{pi},\quad \sum_{j=1}^{n}w_{qj}}\end{aligned} \begin{aligned}EMD(P,Q)={\frac {\sum_{i=1}^{m}\sum_{j=1}^{n}f_{i,j}d_{i,j}}{\sum_{i=1}^{m}\sum_{j=1}^{n}f_{i,j}}}\end{aligned} \begin{aligned}S={(s_{1},w_{s1}),(s_{2},w_{s2}),…,(s_{m},w_{sm})}\end{aligned} \begin{aligned}T={(t_{1},w_{t1}),(t_{2},w_{t2}),…,(t_{n},w_{tn})}\end{aligned} \begin{aligned}D=[d_{i,j}] = || g(s_{i}) − g(t_{j})||\end{aligned} \begin{aligned}sim(S, T) = e−γd(S,T )\end{aligned} EMD application for pseudo data selection $g(p)$ represents mean value of image features in specific cluster from the same category in source domain $g(g_{i})$ is mean value of image features in cluster i from the same category in target domain\begin{aligned}\sum_{i=1}^{m}\sum_{j=1}^{n}f_{i,j}=\min {\sum_{i=1}^{m}w_{pi},\quad \sum_{j=1}^{n}w_{qj}}\end{aligned} \begin{aligned}EMD(P,Q)={\frac {\sum_{i=1}^{m}\sum_{j=1}^{n}f_{i,j}d_{i,j}}{\sum_{i=1}^{m}\sum_{j=1}^{n}f_{i,j}}}\end{aligned} \begin{aligned}P={(p_{1},w_{p1}),(p_{2},w_{p2}),…,(p_{m},w_{pm})}\end{aligned} \begin{aligned}G={(g_{1},w_{g1}),(g_{2},w_{g2}),…,(g_{n},w_{gn})}\end{aligned} \begin{aligned}D=[d_{i,j}] = || g(p_{i}) − g(g_{j})||\end{aligned} \begin{aligned}sim(S, T) = e−γd(S,T )\end{aligned} implementation: calculating the distance between $G(A_1^i)$ and the whole cluster in G(B1). As for distance calculation with EMD method, we obtain $P={G(A_1^i)_{mean},G(A_1^i)_{probs}}$ and $Q={[G(B_1^i)_{mean}, …, G(B_1^K)_{mean}],[G(B_1^i)_{probs}, …, G(B_1^K)_{probs}]}$, so we can calculate distance vector $D=(emd_1,emd_k)$, which is used for obtaining distribution weights $weights_g$.]]></content>

One can think of mixture models as generalizing k-means clustering to incorporate information about the covariance structure of the data as well as the centers of the latent Gaussians. Differentce between k-means and GMM: k-means notes that each point is assigned to different clusters, while GMM can calculate the probabiliy of each point belong to each clusters.
